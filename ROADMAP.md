## Design Principles

1. **Incremental Development**: Each phase produces working code
2. **Learn from Ray**: Study Ray's implementation but adapt to Rust idioms
3. **Performance**: Leverage Rust's zero-cost abstractions
4. **Safety**: Use Rust's type system to prevent errors
5. **Simplicity**: Start simple, add complexity only when needed

## Success Metrics

- **Phase 1**: Can create actors and send messages ‚úÖ
- **Phase 2**: Can execute tasks with dependencies ‚úÖ
- **Phase 3**: API as simple as Ray's Python API
- **Phase 4**: Can share large objects efficiently
- **Phase 5**: Can run actors across multiple nodes
- **Phase 6**: Comparable performance to Ray for basic operations

## Open Questions

1. **Serialization**: Serde vs custom? Compatibility with Ray's protocol?
2. **Async Runtime**: Tokio vs async-std vs custom?
3. **Memory Model**: How closely to follow Plasma's design?
4. **Protocol Compatibility**: Should we aim for Ray protocol compatibility?
5. **Language Bindings**: Python bindings for RustyRay?

## Converting to GitHub Issues

Each numbered item in this roadmap can become a GitHub issue. For example:
- Issue #1: "Implement core types (ActorId, ActorHandle)"
- Issue #2: "Create Actor trait for user-defined actors"
- etc.

We can use GitHub Projects to track phases and milestones for releases.
