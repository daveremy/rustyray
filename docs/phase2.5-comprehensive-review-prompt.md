# Comprehensive RustyRay Code Review Request

Please provide a comprehensive review of the RustyRay codebase as it currently stands after completing Phase 2.5. This is a Rust implementation of Ray Core's distributed actor system.

## Review Scope

Please analyze:

1. **Overall Architecture**
   - How well does the current design align with Ray's architecture?
   - Are the abstractions appropriate for future distributed features?
   - Is the separation of concerns clean and maintainable?

2. **Code Quality**
   - Rust idioms and best practices
   - Error handling patterns
   - Use of async/await and tokio
   - Memory safety and efficiency
   - API design and usability

3. **Task System Implementation**
   - TaskManager and TaskSystem design
   - ObjectRef implementation with watch channels
   - Function registry and task_function! macro
   - Dependency resolution approach
   - Cancellation and timeout mechanisms

4. **Actor System Implementation**
   - Actor trait and lifecycle management
   - Message passing implementation
   - Integration with task system
   - Shutdown mechanisms

5. **Testing**
   - Test coverage and quality
   - Use of synchronization primitives
   - Integration test design

6. **Performance Considerations**
   - Use of Bytes for zero-copy
   - DashMap for concurrent access
   - Allocation patterns
   - Potential bottlenecks

7. **Safety and Correctness**
   - Potential race conditions
   - Error propagation
   - Resource cleanup
   - Deadlock possibilities

8. **API Design**
   - Is the API intuitive and ergonomic?
   - Good use of builder patterns?
   - Type safety and compile-time guarantees

9. **Ready for Distribution?**
   - What needs to be done before adding distributed features?
   - Current limitations that might affect scalability
   - Missing abstractions for networking

10. **Next Steps**
    - Most critical improvements needed
    - Architectural changes to consider
    - Features to prioritize for Phase 3

## Specific Questions

1. Is the current task serialization approach (using bincode) appropriate for distributed execution?
2. Should we consider using Tower or similar service abstractions for the actor system?
3. Is the ObjectRef design flexible enough for distributed object stores?
4. Are there any anti-patterns or "code smells" that should be addressed?
5. How well does this compare to Ray's C++ core implementation approach?

## Context

- We've just completed Phase 2.5 which addressed code review feedback
- The system currently only supports local execution
- Next phases will add distributed features, object store, and GCS
- The goal is to match Ray's core functionality while being idiomatic Rust

Please be thorough but also prioritize the most important findings. Focus especially on architectural decisions that might be hard to change later.
