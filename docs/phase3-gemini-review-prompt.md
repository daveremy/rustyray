# Gemini Review Request: RustyRay Phase 3 Macro System Plan

Please review this implementation plan for Phase 3 of RustyRay, which aims to add a procedural macro system to dramatically improve the API ergonomics. 

## Context

RustyRay is a Rust implementation of Ray Core (the distributed actor system). We've completed:
- Phase 1: Local actor system with message passing
- Phase 2: Task execution system with ObjectRef futures  
- Phase 2.5: Code review improvements (error handling, cancellation, etc.)

The codebase is now stable and well-tested, but the API is verbose compared to Ray's Python API.

## Review Focus Areas

Please evaluate the Phase 3 plan and provide feedback on:

1. **Technical Approach**
   - Is the macro design sound?
   - Are there better alternatives to linkme for compile-time registration?
   - Any concerns about the type generation approach?

2. **API Design**
   - Does the proposed API achieve Python-like simplicity?
   - Are there usability issues we haven't considered?
   - How does this compare to similar macro systems (e.g., PyO3, Rocket)?

3. **Implementation Risks**
   - What are the biggest technical challenges?
   - Are there hidden complexity traps?
   - Performance implications of the macro approach?

4. **Migration Strategy**
   - Is the migration path reasonable?
   - Should we maintain backward compatibility longer?
   - Better approaches for deprecation?

5. **Missing Features**
   - What important use cases are we missing?
   - Additional macro attributes needed?
   - Integration with future distributed features?

## Specific Questions

1. **Actor Method Dispatch**: The plan generates message enums for actor methods. Is this the best approach, or should we consider alternatives like vtables or trait objects?

2. **Error Handling**: How should we handle actor methods that return Result<T, E> where E is a custom error type? Should errors be part of the ObjectRef or separate?

3. **Macro Hygiene**: What hygiene issues should we watch for when generating module-level code?

4. **Testing Strategy**: Beyond trybuild, what testing approaches would ensure macro reliability?

5. **Performance**: Will compile-time registration with linkme scale to thousands of functions?

## Additional Context

Key differences from Ray Python:
- Rust requires compile-time type safety
- No runtime reflection
- Ownership and borrowing rules
- No global interpreter lock

Similar Rust projects for reference:
- Actix Web (actor framework with macros)
- Rocket (web framework with extensive macros)
- PyO3 (Python bindings with proc macros)
- Tower (middleware with service traits)

Please provide:
1. Overall assessment of the plan
2. Specific technical recommendations  
3. Potential pitfalls to avoid
4. Alternative approaches to consider
5. Priority ordering of macro features
