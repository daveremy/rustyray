# Gemini Review Request: Task Argument Serialization Fix

I'm working on RustyRay, a Rust implementation of Ray Core. I've discovered a critical bug in how task arguments are serialized and need your help to:

1. Review my proposed solutions
2. Examine how Ray actually handles this in their C++/Python implementation
3. Recommend the best approach

## Current Bug

Our task system fails with multiple arguments because:
- We serialize each argument individually: `serialize(arg1)`, `serialize(arg2)`
- We concatenate the bytes: `bytes1 + bytes2`
- But functions expect a serialized tuple: `deserialize::<(T1, T2)>(bytes)`

This breaks because `serialize(a) + serialize(b) â‰  serialize((a, b))`

## File References

Please examine these RustyRay files:
- `@~/code/rustyray/src/task/manager.rs` - See the broken `resolve_dependencies` method
- `@~/code/rustyray/src/task/spec.rs` - See how TaskArg is defined
- `@~/code/rustyray/src/task/system.rs` - See how TaskBuilder serializes args
- `@~/code/rustyray/src/task/registry.rs` - See how the macro expects tuples
- `@~/code/rustyray/examples/tasks.rs` - See the workaround avoiding ObjectRef args

## Ray Implementation Analysis Needed

Please examine how Ray handles this:
- `@~/code/ray/src/ray/core_worker/task_manager.cc` - How does Ray manage task arguments?
- `@~/code/ray/src/ray/core_worker/transport.cc` - How are arguments serialized for transport?
- `@~/code/ray/src/ray/protobuf/common.proto` - What's the protobuf structure for task args?
- `@~/code/ray/python/ray/_raylet.pyx` - How does Python serialize task arguments?
- `@~/code/ray/python/ray/_private/serialization.py` - Ray's serialization approach

## Proposed Solutions

Please review the solutions in: `@~/code/rustyray/docs/task-arg-serialization-fix-proposal.md`

## Questions

1. **Ray's Approach**: How does Ray serialize task arguments? As individual values or as a group?

2. **Mixed Arguments**: How does Ray handle tasks where some arguments are concrete values and others are ObjectRef dependencies?

3. **Wire Format**: What's the actual wire format Ray uses for task arguments?

4. **Best Practice**: Given Ray's implementation, which of my proposed solutions is closest to Ray's approach?

5. **Dynamic Tuples**: If Ray does serialize as tuples, how do they handle the dynamic nature (different numbers and types of arguments)?

6. **Alternative**: Is there a better approach I haven't considered that Ray uses?

Please provide:
- Analysis of how Ray solves this problem
- Recommendation on which solution to implement
- Any insights on potential pitfalls or edge cases
- Specific implementation tips based on Ray's approach

Thank you!
