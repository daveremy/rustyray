# Gemini Review Request: RustyRay Phase 3 Macro System Plan

Please review this implementation plan for Phase 3 of RustyRay, which aims to add a procedural macro system to dramatically improve the API ergonomics. I'm providing the full plan and current code examples for context.

## Review Focus Areas

Please evaluate the Phase 3 plan and provide feedback on:

1. **Technical Approach**
   - Is the macro design sound?
   - Are there better alternatives to linkme for compile-time registration?
   - Any concerns about the type generation approach?

2. **API Design**
   - Does the proposed API achieve Python-like simplicity?
   - Are there usability issues we haven't considered?
   - How does this compare to similar macro systems (e.g., PyO3, Rocket)?

3. **Implementation Risks**
   - What are the biggest technical challenges?
   - Are there hidden complexity traps?
   - Performance implications of the macro approach?

4. **Migration Strategy**
   - Is the migration path reasonable?
   - Should we maintain backward compatibility longer?
   - Better approaches for deprecation?

5. **Missing Features**
   - What important use cases are we missing?
   - Additional macro attributes needed?
   - Integration with future distributed features?

## Specific Technical Questions

1. **Actor Method Dispatch**: The plan generates message enums for actor methods. Is this the best approach, or should we consider alternatives like vtables or trait objects?

2. **Error Handling**: How should we handle actor methods that return Result<T, E> where E is a custom error type? Should errors be part of the ObjectRef or separate?

3. **Macro Hygiene**: What hygiene issues should we watch for when generating module-level code?

4. **Testing Strategy**: Beyond trybuild, what testing approaches would ensure macro reliability?

5. **Performance**: Will compile-time registration with linkme scale to thousands of functions?

## Command to run:

```bash
cd ~/code/rustyray && gemini -p "@docs/phase3-implementation-plan.md @docs/macro-implementation-plan.md @examples/future_api_vision.rs.txt @src/actor/mod.rs @src/task/system.rs @examples/tasks.rs Review the Phase 3 macro system plan for RustyRay. Focus on: 1) Technical soundness of the macro approach, 2) API usability compared to Ray Python, 3) Implementation risks and challenges, 4) Missing features or use cases, 5) Better alternatives or improvements. Provide specific technical recommendations and identify potential pitfalls."
