# Phase 5.5: Development Infrastructure & CI/CD

## Overview

Before implementing Phase 6 (Garbage Collection & Production Features), we need to establish professional development practices to support collaborative development and ensure code quality.

## Motivation

- Project is maturing beyond single-developer exploration
- Need to prevent regressions as complexity grows
- Enable safe concurrent development with multiple contributors
- Establish quality gates before production features
- Move from roadmap-driven to issue-driven development

## Goals

### 1. GitHub Issue-Based Planning
- Convert roadmap items to GitHub issues
- Create issue templates for bugs, features, and tasks
- Establish labels and milestones
- Link PRs to issues
- Track progress through project boards

### 2. Git Branching Workflow
- Protect main branch
- Feature branch workflow (feature/, fix/, docs/)
- Require PRs for all changes
- Establish PR review process
- Squash and merge strategy

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated testing on every PR
- Code formatting checks (rustfmt)
- Linting (clippy)
- Security audits (cargo audit)
- Documentation builds
- Test coverage reporting
- Release automation

### 4. Development Tooling
- Pre-commit hooks
- Local development scripts
- Standardized development environment
- Performance benchmarking baseline
- Dependency update automation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 5.5.1: GitHub Setup (1-2 days)

#### Issue Templates
Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:
- `bug_report.md`
- `feature_request.md`
- `task.md`
- `config.yml` for template chooser

#### PR Template
Create `.github/pull_request_template.md`

#### Labels
- Type: bug, feature, task, docs
- Priority: P0, P1, P2, P3
- Status: needs-triage, ready, in-progress, blocked
- Difficulty: good-first-issue, medium, hard

#### Branch Protection
- Require PR reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Include administrators

### Phase 5.5.2: CI/CD Pipeline (2-3 days)

#### GitHub Actions Workflows

**`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - Main CI pipeline
- Triggers: PR, push to main
- Matrix: OS (Linux, macOS, Windows), Rust (stable, nightly)
- Steps:
  1. Checkout
  2. Cache (cargo, target)
  3. Format check (cargo fmt)
  4. Lint (cargo clippy)
  5. Build
  6. Test (with --test-threads=1)
  7. Doc build
  8. Coverage (tarpaulin/llvm-cov)

**`.github/workflows/security.yml`** - Security checks
- Triggers: PR, schedule (daily)
- cargo audit
- dependency review

**`.github/workflows/release.yml`** - Release automation
- Triggers: version tag (v*)
- Build release binaries
- Create GitHub release
- Update changelog
- Publish to crates.io (future)

**`.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml`** - Performance tracking
- Triggers: PR (with label), push to main
- Run benchmarks
- Compare with baseline
- Comment on PR with results

### Phase 5.5.3: Development Workflow (1 day)

#### Pre-commit Hooks
`.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
- rustfmt
- clippy
- test (subset)
- commit message format

#### Scripts
Enhance `scripts/` directory:
- `dev-setup.sh` - Set up development environment
- `pre-commit.sh` - Run all checks locally
- `create-issue.sh` - Create issue from command line
- `benchmark.sh` - Run benchmarks locally

#### Documentation
Update `CONTRIBUTING.md`:
- Branching strategy
- PR process
- Issue workflow
- Review guidelines
- Release process

### Phase 5.5.4: Issue Migration (2 days)

Convert ROADMAP.md items to GitHub issues:
1. Create milestones for each phase
2. Create issues for each uncompleted task
3. Add appropriate labels
4. Set up project board
5. Archive completed items

## Success Criteria

1. **CI/CD Operational**
   - All PRs run through CI
   - No commits to main without PR
   - Automated release process works

2. **Issue Tracking Active**
   - All work tracked in issues
   - Clear prioritization
   - Progress visible on project board

3. **Quality Gates Enforced**
   - No formatting issues
   - No clippy warnings
   - Tests pass on all platforms
   - Coverage baseline established

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Clear contribution process
   - Fast CI feedback (<10 min)
   - Helpful PR templates
   - Easy local development

## Timeline

- Total: 1 week
- Can be done incrementally
- Main branch protection after CI is ready
- Issue migration can be gradual

## Benefits

1. **Quality**: Catch issues before merge
2. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work safely
3. **Transparency**: Progress visible to community
4. **Automation**: Less manual work for releases
5. **Professional**: Industry-standard practices

## Next Steps

1. Create this design doc as first PR using new workflow
2. Set up basic CI pipeline
3. Enable branch protection
4. Start using feature branches
5. Migrate one phase worth of issues as pilot

This infrastructure investment will pay dividends as we implement the remaining phases and grow the contributor base.
