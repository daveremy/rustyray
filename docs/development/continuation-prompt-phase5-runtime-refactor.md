# Continuation Prompt - Phase 5: Runtime Refactor Complete

## Context
You are working on RustyRay, a Rust implementation of Ray Core (distributed actor system). You've just completed Phase 5, which involved a major refactoring of the runtime architecture to fix concurrent test execution issues.

## Current Status

### What Was Completed in Phase 5

1. **Runtime Architecture Refactor**
   - Changed from `OnceCell<Runtime>` to `RwLock<Option<Arc<Runtime>>>` 
   - Made runtime re-initializable after shutdown
   - Maintains thread safety while allowing proper lifecycle management
   - Located in: `/crates/rustyray-core/src/runtime.rs`

2. **Test Infrastructure Updates**
   - Created `with_test_runtime()` fixture for proper test isolation
   - Migrated ALL tests to use the new fixture pattern
   - Added concurrent test detection with clear error messages
   - Located in: `/crates/rustyray-core/src/test_utils.rs`

3. **Fixed ObjectRef Resolution Bug**
   - `ray::put()` wasn't notifying TaskManager about new objects
   - Fixed by making `ray::put()` use TaskSystem's put method
   - This ensures proper dependency tracking for tasks

4. **Test Execution Requirements**
   - Tests must run with `--test-threads=1` for isolation
   - Runtime FULLY supports concurrent actors/tasks
   - Added multiple enforcement mechanisms:
     - Makefile with `make test` command
     - Test script at `scripts/test.sh`  
     - Atomic detection in test fixtures
     - Comprehensive documentation in `README_TESTING.md`

5. **Macro Updates**
   - Fixed `#[remote]` macro to handle `Arc<Runtime>` return type
   - All examples now build and run successfully

### Test Results
- 68 library tests: ✅ PASSED
- 5 actor_task_integration tests: ✅ PASSED  
- 5 integration_tests: ✅ PASSED
- Total: 78 tests passing

### Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Global Runtime Pattern** - Following Ray's design with one runtime per process
2. **Explicit Lifecycle** - `init()`, `shutdown()`, `global()`, `is_initialized()`
3. **Re-initializable** - Runtime can be shutdown and re-initialized
4. **Test Isolation** - Tests use fixtures to ensure clean runtime state

## Important Files Modified

1. `/crates/rustyray-core/src/runtime.rs` - Core runtime implementation
2. `/crates/rustyray-core/src/test_utils.rs` - Test fixtures and utilities
3. `/crates/rustyray-core/src/ray.rs` - Fixed put/get to use TaskSystem
4. `/crates/rustyray-macros/src/remote.rs` - Fixed macro for Arc<Runtime>
5. All test files updated to use `with_test_runtime` fixture

## Next Steps

1. **Comprehensive Code Review** - Use Gemini to review the entire codebase
2. **Documentation Updates** - Ensure all docs reflect the new architecture
3. **Performance Testing** - Verify no performance regressions
4. **Integration Examples** - More complex examples showing distributed patterns

## Known Limitations

1. **Test Concurrency** - Tests must run single-threaded (by design, matches Ray)
2. **Global State** - One runtime per process (intentional, Ray-compatible)

## Architecture Overview

```rust
// Old (Phase 4)
static RUNTIME: OnceCell<Runtime> = OnceCell::new();

// New (Phase 5)  
static RUNTIME: RwLock<Option<Arc<Runtime>>> = RwLock::new(None);

// Usage
ray::init()?;                    // Initialize runtime
let obj = ray::put(data).await?; // Store data
let val = ray::get(&obj).await?; // Retrieve data
ray::shutdown()?;                // Clean shutdown
```

## Testing Pattern

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_something() {
    with_test_runtime(|| async {
        // Test code here - runtime is initialized
        let obj_ref = ray::put(42).await.unwrap();
        let value = ray::get(&obj_ref).await.unwrap();
        assert_eq!(value, 42);
    }).await;
    // Runtime is automatically cleaned up
}
```

## Commands

- Run tests: `make test` or `cargo test -- --test-threads=1`
- Run specific test: `make test-one TEST=test_name`
- Build: `cargo build`
- Run examples: `cargo run --example macros_demo`

## For Code Review

Key areas to review:
1. Thread safety of the new runtime architecture
2. Correctness of the test fixtures
3. ObjectRef serialization and resolution
4. Task dependency tracking
5. Actor-task integration via object store

The codebase is now ready for a comprehensive review before committing Phase 5.
