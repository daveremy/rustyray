# Continuation Prompt - Phase 5 Complete

## Context
You are working on RustyRay, a Rust implementation of Ray Core (distributed actor system). You've just completed a comprehensive code review of Phase 5, which involved a major refactoring of the runtime architecture to fix concurrent test execution issues.

## Current Status - Phase 5 Complete

### What Was Completed
1. **Runtime Architecture Refactor**
   - Changed from `OnceCell<Runtime>` to `RwLock<Option<Arc<Runtime>>>` 
   - Made runtime re-initializable after shutdown
   - Maintains thread safety while allowing proper lifecycle management
   - Located in: `/crates/rustyray-core/src/runtime.rs`

2. **Test Infrastructure Updates**
   - Created `with_test_runtime()` fixture with panic safety using `futures::FutureExt::catch_unwind`
   - Migrated ALL tests to use the new fixture pattern
   - Added concurrent test detection with clear error messages
   - Located in: `/crates/rustyray-core/src/test_utils.rs`

3. **Fixed ObjectRef Resolution Bug**
   - `ray::put()` now correctly uses TaskSystem's put method
   - This ensures proper dependency tracking for tasks
   - Fixed integration test to match current TaskManager behavior (ObjectRefs are resolved to values)

4. **Updated Examples**
   - All examples now use `runtime::init()` pattern
   - Examples properly shutdown runtime
   - Located in: `/crates/rustyray-core/examples/`

### Test Results
- Total: **84 tests passing** (up from 78)
- Tests must run with `--test-threads=1` for isolation
- Runtime FULLY supports concurrent actors/tasks
- Test isolation requirement is only for runtime lifecycle

### Key Architecture Decisions
1. **Global Runtime Pattern** - Following Ray's design with one runtime per process
2. **Explicit Lifecycle** - `init()`, `shutdown()`, `global()`, `is_initialized()`
3. **Re-initializable** - Runtime can be shutdown and re-initialized
4. **Test Isolation** - Tests use fixtures to ensure clean runtime state

## Code Review Summary

A comprehensive code review was conducted using multiple specialized agents analyzing:
- Runtime architecture and thread safety
- Test infrastructure and panic safety
- Performance implications
- Security and safety
- API and user experience
- Code complexity
- Error handling patterns
- Memory management
- Documentation completeness
- Integration tests and examples

Full review available in: `/docs/phase5-code-review.md`

### Critical Issues Identified (High Priority)

1. **Resource Cleanup Order**
   - Runtime shutdown doesn't explicitly call subsystem shutdown
   - Fix: Add explicit shutdown sequence calling task_system.shutdown() then actor_system.shutdown()

2. **Lock Poisoning**
   - Using `.unwrap()` on locks could cascade failures
   - Fix: Handle poisoned locks gracefully with `.unwrap_or_else(|poisoned| poisoned.into_inner())`

### Medium Priority Issues
- No garbage collection for object store
- Limited error recovery mechanisms
- Tests must run serially

### Low Priority Issues
- No performance monitoring/metrics
- No memory limits or backpressure
- Documentation gaps in architecture

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Commit)
1. Fix the two high-priority issues identified in code review
2. Run all tests to ensure fixes don't break anything
3. Commit Phase 5

### Phase 6 Recommendations
Based on the code review and Ray comparison:

1. **Garbage Collection System**
   - Reference counting for object store entries
   - Periodic cleanup of orphaned objects
   - Memory pressure handling

2. **Production Features**
   - Metrics and monitoring integration
   - Health check endpoints
   - Resource usage limits
   - Graceful shutdown with work draining

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Retry mechanisms for transient failures
   - Richer error context (task ID, actor ID, etc.)
   - Error recovery strategies

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Consider using `parking_lot::RwLock` to avoid lock poisoning
   - Cache runtime references to reduce lock contention
   - Profile and optimize hot paths

## Key Files Modified in Phase 5
- `/crates/rustyray-core/src/runtime.rs` - Core runtime implementation
- `/crates/rustyray-core/src/test_utils.rs` - Test fixtures and utilities
- `/crates/rustyray-core/src/ray.rs` - Fixed put/get to use TaskSystem
- `/crates/rustyray-macros/src/remote.rs` - Fixed macro for Arc<Runtime>
- All test files updated to use `with_test_runtime` fixture
- All examples updated to use runtime pattern

## Commands
- Run tests: `make test` or `cargo test -- --test-threads=1`
- Run specific test: `make test-one TEST=test_name`
- Build: `cargo build`
- Run examples: `cargo run --example <example_name>`

## Architecture Overview

```rust
// Phase 5 Runtime Pattern
static RUNTIME: RwLock<Option<Arc<Runtime>>> = RwLock::new(None);

// Usage
ray::init()?;                    // Initialize runtime
let obj = ray::put(data).await?; // Store data
let val = ray::get(&obj).await?; // Retrieve data
ray::shutdown()?;                // Clean shutdown

// Test Pattern
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_something() {
    with_test_runtime(|| async {
        // Test code here - runtime is initialized
        let obj_ref = ray::put(42).await.unwrap();
        let value = ray::get(&obj_ref).await.unwrap();
        assert_eq!(value, 42);
    }).await;
    // Runtime is automatically cleaned up
}
```

## Known Limitations
1. **Test Concurrency** - Tests must run single-threaded (by design, matches Ray)
2. **Global State** - One runtime per process (intentional, Ray-compatible)
3. **No Migration Guide** - Not needed as no users yet

The codebase is ready for Phase 5 commit after fixing the two high-priority issues.
