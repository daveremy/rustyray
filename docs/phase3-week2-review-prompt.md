# Phase 3 Week 2 Code Review Request

Please review the Phase 3 Week 2 implementation of RustyRay's actor macro system. This week focused on implementing `#[actor]` and `#[actor_methods]` macros to provide a clean, type-safe API for distributed actors.

## Context
- **Previous**: Week 1 implemented `#[remote]` macro for stateless functions
- **This Week**: Actor macros for stateful computation
- **Goal**: Match Ray's actor API ergonomics in Rust

## Key Files to Review

### 1. Actor Macro Implementation
- `@crates/rustyray-macros/src/actor.rs` - Main implementation
- `@crates/rustyray-macros/src/utils.rs` - Enhanced type detection utilities

### 2. Examples and Tests
- `@crates/rustyray/examples/actor_demo.rs` - Working example
- `@crates/rustyray/tests/actor_tests.rs` - Integration tests
- `@crates/rustyray-macros/tests/ui/fail/` - Error case tests

### 3. Documentation
- `@docs/phase3-technical-debt.md` - Known issues and future improvements

## What Was Implemented

### 1. #[actor] Macro
Generates:
- Serde derives for serialization
- Typed handle struct (e.g., `CounterHandle`)
- Metadata for actor_methods to use

### 2. #[actor_methods] Macro
Generates:
- Message and response enums
- Actor wrapper implementing the Actor trait
- Handle methods that return `ObjectRef<T>`
- Constructor mapping: `new` → `remote()`, others → `remote_<name>()`

### 3. Type Detection Improvements
- Fixed ObjectRef detection to handle:
  - `ObjectRef<T>`
  - `rustyray::ObjectRef<T>`
  - `rustyray_core::ObjectRef<T>`
  - `&ObjectRef<T>`

## Target API Achieved
```rust
#[rustyray::actor]
struct Counter {
    value: i32,
}

#[rustyray::actor_methods]
impl Counter {
    pub fn new(initial: i32) -> Self {
        Counter { value: initial }
    }
    
    pub async fn increment(&mut self) -> i32 {
        self.value += 1;
        self.value
    }
}

// Usage:
let counter = Counter::remote(0).await?;
let result = counter.increment().await?.get().await?;
```

## Specific Review Questions

1. **Macro Design**
   - Is the message/response enum generation approach sound?
   - Should we use traits instead of enums for extensibility?
   - Is the constructor naming convention (remote_<name>) intuitive?

2. **Type Safety**
   - Are there edge cases in the type detection we missed?
   - Is the Actor trait integration correct?
   - Any potential lifetime issues?

3. **Performance**
   - Is the serialization approach efficient?
   - Should we cache type information?
   - Any unnecessary allocations?

4. **Error Handling**
   - Are the error messages clear enough?
   - Should we add more compile-time validations?
   - Missing error cases?

5. **API Ergonomics**
   - Is the double await pattern (`.await?.get().await?`) acceptable?
   - Should we provide convenience methods?
   - How does this compare to Ray's Python API?

## Known Limitations
- No generic actor support yet
- Type aliases for ObjectRef not detected
- All methods must be serializable
- No actor lifecycle hooks yet

## Testing Approach
- Integration tests for runtime behavior
- Minimal trybuild tests for key error messages
- Examples demonstrating usage patterns

Please provide:
1. Overall assessment (A-F grade)
2. Critical issues that must be fixed
3. Suggestions for improvement
4. Comparison with Ray's actor implementation
5. Any security or safety concerns
