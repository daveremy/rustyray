# Phase 5 Complete: Runtime Architecture Refactor

## Overview
Phase 5 involved a major refactoring of the runtime architecture to fix concurrent test execution issues while maintaining the global runtime pattern that matches Ray's design.

## Key Changes

### 1. Runtime Architecture Refactor
- Changed from `OnceCell<Runtime>` to `RwLock<Option<Arc<Runtime>>>`
- Made runtime re-initializable after shutdown
- Maintains thread safety while allowing proper lifecycle management
- Added poison lock recovery for resilience

### 2. Test Infrastructure Updates
- Created `with_test_runtime()` fixture with panic safety
- Uses `futures::FutureExt::catch_unwind` for test isolation
- Migrated ALL tests to use the new fixture pattern
- Added concurrent test detection with clear error messages

### 3. Fixed Critical Bugs
- `ray::put()` now correctly uses TaskSystem's put method for dependency tracking
- Fixed integration test to match current TaskManager behavior
- Added proper subsystem shutdown ordering

### 4. API Enhancements
- Added `runtime::shutdown_async()` for graceful async shutdown
- Maintained synchronous `shutdown()` for test compatibility
- Clear lifecycle: `init()`, `shutdown()`, `global()`, `is_initialized()`

## Test Results
- **Total: 84 tests passing** (up from 78)
- Tests must run with `--test-threads=1` for isolation
- Runtime FULLY supports concurrent actors/tasks
- Test isolation requirement is only for runtime lifecycle

## Architecture Decisions
1. **Global Runtime Pattern** - Following Ray's design with one runtime per process
2. **Explicit Lifecycle** - Clear initialization and shutdown APIs
3. **Re-initializable** - Runtime can be shutdown and re-initialized
4. **Test Isolation** - Tests use fixtures to ensure clean runtime state

## Code Review Findings

### High Priority Issues (Fixed)
1. ✅ Resource cleanup order - Added explicit subsystem shutdown
2. ✅ Lock poisoning - Using `unwrap_or_else(|poisoned| poisoned.into_inner())`

### Medium Priority Issues (Future Work)
1. No garbage collection for object store
2. Limited error recovery mechanisms  
3. Tests must run serially

### Low Priority Issues (Future Work)
1. No performance monitoring/metrics
2. No memory limits or backpressure
3. Documentation gaps in architecture

## Breaking Changes
None - All APIs remain backward compatible.

## Migration Guide
No migration needed for existing code. The runtime changes are internal.

## Performance Impact
Minimal - The RwLock is only accessed during initialization/shutdown, not during normal operation.

## Next Steps
Based on the code review, Phase 6 should focus on:
1. Garbage collection system with reference counting
2. Production features (metrics, health checks, resource limits)
3. Enhanced error handling with retry mechanisms
4. Performance optimizations (parking_lot, caching)
