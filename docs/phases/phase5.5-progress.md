# Phase 5.5 Progress: Development Infrastructure

## Overview

Phase 5.5 establishes professional development practices including CI/CD, issue tracking, and collaborative workflows.

## What We've Created

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline (.github/workflows/)

#### ci.yml
- Multi-platform testing (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Rust stable (nightly ready when needed)
- Format checking with rustfmt
- Linting with clippy
- Code coverage with llvm-cov
- Security audit integration
- Documentation build verification

#### release.yml
- Automated release creation from tags
- Changelog extraction
- Cross-platform binary builds (ready for future)
- Crates.io publishing preparation

### 2. Issue Management

#### Issue Templates (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/)
- **bug_report.md**: Structured bug reporting
- **feature_request.md**: Feature proposals
- **task.md**: Development tasks from roadmap

#### PR Template
- **pull_request_template.md**: Consistent PR format with checklist

#### Label Strategy (docs/LABEL_STRATEGY.md)
Comprehensive labeling system with:
- Type labels (bug, feature, task, docs, etc.)
- Priority labels (critical, high, medium, low)
- Status labels (needs-triage, ready, in-progress, blocked)
- Effort labels (good-first-issue, easy, medium, hard)
- Component labels (area:actor-system, area:task-system, etc.)
- Phase labels (phase:5.5, phase:6, etc.)
- Meta labels (security, performance, breaking-change)

#### Scripts
- **create-labels.sh**: Automated label creation
- **create-phase-5.5-issues.sh**: Example issue creation

### 3. Documentation

#### New Documents
- **LABEL_STRATEGY.md**: Complete label guide
- **ISSUE_CREATION_GUIDE.md**: How to create good issues
- **phase5.5-development-infrastructure.md**: Phase design doc

#### Updated Documents
- **ROADMAP.md**: Added Phase 5.5 section
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Ready for workflow updates

## What's Ready to Deploy

### Immediate Actions (Can do now)
1. Push this branch to GitHub
2. Run `./scripts/create-labels.sh` to create labels
3. Run `./scripts/create-phase-5.5-issues.sh` to create initial issues
4. CI will automatically activate on push

### After CI Proves Stable
1. Enable branch protection rules
2. Require PR reviews
3. Require CI checks to pass

## Benefits Already Achieved

1. **Quality Gates**: Every PR will be checked automatically
2. **Consistent Process**: Templates guide contributions
3. **Clear Organization**: Label strategy enables filtering/tracking
4. **Automated Releases**: Tag pushes trigger release process
5. **Multi-Platform**: Testing across OS platforms

## Next Steps

### High Priority
- [ ] Push Phase 5.5 branch
- [ ] Create labels on GitHub
- [ ] Create initial issues
- [ ] Test CI pipeline

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Set up branch protection (after CI stable)
- [ ] Create remaining Phase 5.5 issues
- [ ] Update CONTRIBUTING.md

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Create more automation scripts
- [ ] Set up project board

## Migration Strategy

1. **Start with Phase 5.5**: Use as pilot for new process
2. **Gradually add issues**: Don't overwhelm with all phases at once
3. **Refine as we go**: Adjust labels, templates based on usage
4. **Document learnings**: Update guides based on experience

## Success Metrics

- CI runs on every PR
- All new work goes through PRs
- Issues have consistent labels
- Contributors find process clear
- Release automation works

## Technical Decisions

1. **GitHub Actions over alternatives**: Native integration
2. **llvm-cov over tarpaulin**: More reliable, faster
3. **Swatinem/rust-cache**: Best Rust caching action
4. **Label prefixes**: Easier filtering and grouping
5. **Milestone per phase**: Clear progress tracking

This infrastructure investment enables sustainable growth as we implement the remaining phases and grow the contributor community.
